# Homebrew Tap for Python2

[![brew test-bot](https://github.com/curoky/homebrew-python2/actions/workflows/tests.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/curoky/homebrew-python2/actions/workflows/tests.yml)

Homebrew removed python2 support, see [here](https://github.com/Homebrew/homebrew-core/pull/49796) for more details.

I extracted the last [version](https://github.com/Homebrew/linuxbrew-core/commits/master?branch=master&path%5B%5D=Formula&path%5B%5D=python@2.rb) of `python@2.rb` and put it here for maintenance.

## Usage

`brew install curoky/python2/python@2`

Or `brew tap curoky/python2` and then `brew install python@2`.
